# 🌍 Viator-Style Event Booking App

This project is a full-stack **event booking web application** inspired by Viator / Tripadvisor platforms. It was developed as part of my technical preparation for an interview with Viator.

The main goal was to replicate a realistic booking system using the **same or similar technologies** used by Viator, including **GraphQL**, **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **React with TypeScript**.
